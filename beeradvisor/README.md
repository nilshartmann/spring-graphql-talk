## Login / Users

To add new ratings for a Beer you need to login.

You can do either:

- if you're in the frontend, use one of the following users names: "waldemar","karl", "alessa", "lauren" or "nils" and use any string longer than five chars as password
- if you're using GraphiQL and want to run a mutation, you can find a header with JSON Web Token (JWT) in the console log from the backend process 
  when the backend process starts (Search for `NEVER EXPIRING JWT TOKEN`. Copy this header to the `Request Headers` tab at the bottom of the page in GraphiQL.
